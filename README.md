# Hello This is Kareem :)
### How i started to code ‚å®Ô∏è
i started to look into programming when i faced a lot of situations that i told my self in "damn i wish i knew how to code" then every thing began 
and i started to search for the best programming language to start with and it was python , almost any thing you can imagine doing you will find python come in hand 
i started learning the basics and slowly going into deep stuff like working with API's , WebScraping , Automation and more 
---
### Why i started Github üö∂
it seemes like a good idea to share my work and get feedback but no social media site seemed to do the work until i found Github 
---
### What i am interested in 
i am interested in any thing that saves time and effort which includes Automation and Scripting "If the computer can do so make it do it"
---
### My Goals for 2022 üéØ
i am aiming hopfully this year to :-
*improve my skills in python more and more and really master this language 
*learn another general purposed scripting language like python (propaply Go , Js or Dart not sure yet)
